Slim SEO is a full-featured SEO plugin, thatâ€™s done right! It provides a complete SEO solution for WordPress where the configuration has been done automatically. Users do not need to care about their complex and semantic options.

This SEO plugin is in the process of developing and perfecting. Most of the time, my tasks are fixing bugs, resolved tickets on support forum. I've also been working on a feature of premium version named Schema Builder.

export default ({ children }) => <Single meta={meta}>{children}</Single>;
