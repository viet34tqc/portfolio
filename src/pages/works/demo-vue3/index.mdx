This is an relative simple demo of Vue 3 using composition API. You can search for the location and display the weather of that location. This is done by calling third party API. In addition, you can save that location in local storage.

This project use:

- `vue-router` package to navigate between routes
- `Suspense` component from Vue to lazy load the route.
- `Transition` component for smooth navigation.
